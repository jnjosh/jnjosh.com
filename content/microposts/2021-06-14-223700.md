Using an iPad to take notes in a side by side multitasking is actually pretty nice. Tonight I loaded up a few more WWDC videos on the left and [Craft](https://www.craft.do) for notes on the right. Of course this could have been an article, a YouTube video, or anything really. I've been trying to be more diligent in note taking and this is a pretty good option. I'm looking forward to some of the new features in [iPadOS 15](https://www.apple.com/ipados/ipados-preview/)!
