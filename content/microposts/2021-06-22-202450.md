I realized last week that <span class="yellow-highlight">meetings are liquid</span>â€”like cats! I cleared a few things off my calendar only to find things suddenly pop up in those time slots. I actually think this is fine, my role is about helping the team I work with but it can get draining. So depending on what I need to do, I'll create some private meetings for myself to block off time to get focused work completed. I still leave gaps and am quick to move things if needed, but overall it's helped me be available and still get some tasks done.
