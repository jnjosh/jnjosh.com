I'm up way too late tonight, but for an investigation into [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), Google's declarative UI system like SwiftUI. After wrapping up my [little SwiftUI project](/posts/swift-time-capsule/) I thought it would be interesting to see what the Android developers have in coming. Also Android Studio runs on my M1 Mac now! Some early things I've noticed, State is not as easily definable as SwiftUI and getting all the right versions set up in gradle is a small hassle. I'm amazed at how easy it is now to get a small API client up and running on both platforms!
