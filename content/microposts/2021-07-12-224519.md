One of my favorite things about learning languages is learning different idioms from different cultures. I first noticed this when learning German and learned that the equivalent idiom to "That's water under the bridge" is "Das ist doch Schnee von gestern" ("that is snow from yesterday"). Tonight in studying Portuguese I learned that instead of "I smell a rat", they'd say "aqui hÃ¡ gato" ("there is a cat here"). ğŸ˜†
