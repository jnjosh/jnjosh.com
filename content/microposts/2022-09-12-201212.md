I'm constantly overwhelmed with all the things I want to do. From learning new languages to buying an FPV drone to blogging on this site—it's almost a task just to keep up with the new things I want to try or learn. Unfortunately it often leads to me doing nothing or just watching YouTube. It was YouTube though that brought me across the idea of an ["Energy Portfolio"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ombpvrlglfU). The big idea is to write down all the things you want in a "backlog" or "bucket list" then have 3–4 items in an "Active" list at any time. I've been trying it for the last few weeks. It's hard but the biggest thing is to give myself permission not to explore all the ideas and just focus on the few I've currently chosen.
