Last week [Nat](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYDbjsTtI2k/) and I took part in a video editing challenge from the folks at [TMS Productions](https://tmsmedia.ca/edit). Most of the footage comes from them, but I added a few shots of me typing a script to add a bit of a story. Honda's Rebel website has a tagline of "Escape the Ordinary" which I thought would play nicely with the idea that someone is writing a screenplay about riding this motorcycle to "Escape the Ordinary". Also, all [Music and Sound Effects came from Epidemic Sound](https://www.epidemicsound.com).
