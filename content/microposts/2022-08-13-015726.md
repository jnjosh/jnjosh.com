First week at Adobe was great, I've learned a lot already, started meeting the overall team, and have started a couple small learning projects. At one point I joked I was "drinking from the firehose". One person shared the gif below and another said I found the "marble in the oatmeal". A first week including [UHF](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0098546/) references might be the best first week.
