Why is it that I can remember the lyrics to songs that I haven't heard in 10â€“20 years? It blows my mind every time, it's like my brain back then heard these songs and said "_this is required for survival!_". Last week I played [Better than Ezra's "Good"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acK0KH2uJGc) for the first time since maybe the late 90s and I remembered every lyric. How can I channel this super power?
