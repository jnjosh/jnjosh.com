I've recently been making some updates to the theme that drives this site, [`internet-weblog`](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog). I'm slowly updating it to follow more modern standards and add new features. First was a bugfix to support newer versions of [Hugo](https://gohugo.io), followed by two new features: Open Graph metadata with featured images and automatic dark appearance support. If you have things you'd like to see please let me know on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jnjosh) or open a PR in Github!
