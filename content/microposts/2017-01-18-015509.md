I had a couple good tweet conversations about my [Social Network for Coders post](http://jnjosh.com/posts/social-network-for-coders/). [@louielouie](https://twitter.com/louielouie/status/821050286550695937) mentioned the lack of a twitter-like feed and client but also added that there is a lot of commit noise when dealing with source control repos. [@evercode](https://twitter.com/evercode/status/821504537777373185) thought there should also be a forum-like interface or even something like Reddit. I'm not sure what would come of this but I like the conversation. Maybe some day Github will add more community features? Or maybe this should be something built as a coordination between Github and another service?
