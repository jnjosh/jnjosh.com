I've been starting to read more articles and books about being a better Engineering Manager, so far I've read some great books like [Crucial Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/Crucial-Conversations-Talking-Stakes-Edition/dp/0071771328) and [An Elegant Puzzle](https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management-ebook/dp/B07QYCHJ7V). Today I found [this Github resource that's a booklist for Engineering Managers](https://github.com/jesselpalmer/the-engineering-managers-booklist) by [@jesselpalmer](https://twitter.com/jesselpalmer). It has the books I've already read and many more!
