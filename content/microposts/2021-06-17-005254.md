Now that we are halfway through 2021, I was looking at the movies I've watched so far. [The count is already at 41 movies](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/year/2021/) but we don't have a goal like our [2020 goal of 100 movies](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/year/2020/). Some of the highlights for me are [Nomadland](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/film/nomadland/), [The Forty-Year-Old Version](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/film/the-forty-year-old-version/), [The Midnight Sky](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/film/the-midnight-sky/), and [Space Sweepers](https://letterboxd.com/jnjosh/film/space-sweepers/). All worth checking out if you haven't seen them.
