Yesterday, I made a very minor update to my [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) [internet-weblog](https://github.com/jnjosh/internet-weblog) theme that drives this site. The micropost formats looked different to regular posts but I cleaned it up a bit more making it a little lighter feeling. Additionally I improved the menu to not have a background, which always bugged me a little. I published it and thought I broke something, but then learned that newer versions of [Hugo use a new Markdown tool](https://gohugo.io/news/0.60.0-relnotes/) which requires running in unsafe mode for any raw HTML in the Markdown.
