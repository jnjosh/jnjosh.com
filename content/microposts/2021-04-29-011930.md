I've started taking a ten-week-long online Japanese class. The idea is to learn with stories. It's been interesting and a large departure from just trying to learn Kanji. I'm about 1/3 of the way through [Remembering the Kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remembering_the_Kanji_and_Remembering_the_Hanzi) and I still can't read actual sentences or understand content. It's a fun book but I think I need to make more progress with basics first. I can learn Kanji as I go too. The stories this class uses are very repetitive but it seems to work well as I feel like I can understand some basic sentences already. Excited for more!
