Hi, I‚Äôm Josh Johnson. I‚Äôm a software developer and engineering leader living in Raleigh-Durham, NC. Most people don't call it that but I actually live in Raleigh city, but Durham county. It's weird. My congressional district changes pretty much every voting cycle. I enjoy Durham much more, so let's just say Durham.

<br />

I love creating software for Mac and iOS. For years I wrote software for Windows and the Web, but when the iPhone was introduced in 2007 I dusted off my old 12‚Äù PowerBook and started to seriously learn Cocoa. I've worked with many teams building iOS apps, led teams of iOS developers at Two Toasters (later Ticketmaster) and [Grubhub](https://www.grubhub.com). Previously, I was the organizer of Triangle CocoaHeads and NSCoder Nights and occasionally [speak at conferences](/speaking) about Cocoa development. Currently, I'm a Sr. Design Engineering Manager at [Adobe](https://www.adobe.com).

<br />

In my spare time, I've started doing more [photography](https://jnjosh.photography) and some filmmaking. I enjoy learning languages but currently not studying‚ÄîPreviously focused an many languages including German, Japanese, Ukrainian, Spanish, and Portuguese. I also really enjoy cooking and [keyboards](/categories/keyboards). I'm basically a nerd that has too many interests and spend a lot of my time trying to prioritize them. I watch too much on YouTube.
