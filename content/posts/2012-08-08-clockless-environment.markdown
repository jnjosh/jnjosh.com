Last year I [wrote a post about how I was going to work without a clock](http://log.jsh.in/posts/back-to-blogging-and-working-without-a-clock/). This was completely inspired by [Cocoa developer Zach Waugh who wrote about the same topic](http://blog.zachwaugh.com/post/6290996753/working-without-a-clock). As part of this post, he also talked about his small [Mac app called Clock.app](http://zachwaugh.com/clock) which is an open source project. Since you sometimes need to know the time, the app provides a quick way to get the time using Alfred or Quicksilver to launch this simple app. For example, you can type `cmd+space cl [enter]` and I the time.

I actually stopped doing this for awhile. I'm not sure why. I love working this way and recently went back to the clock-free environment. It works so well for me that when I'm working on an app on my phone and see the time, I get a little upset.

One small problem I had was I often used the clock to identify the date. Since it was open source, I forked it and updated Clock.app to have the date.

**If you'd like to try it out, you can [download the built version from Github](https://github.com/jnjosh/Clock.app/downloads) or [checkout the source](https://github.com/jnjosh/Clock.app).**
