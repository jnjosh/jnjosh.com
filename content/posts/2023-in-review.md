I almost forgot to blog this year! It's now the last minute—9pm on December 31—and the only thing I could think of was to write was a sort of 'Year in Review' of the movies, TV, and music I've enjoyed this year. It is something I've wanted to do before anyway, so why not start the tradition? So if you'll indulge me here are a few interesting movies, shows, and songs I was entertained by in 2023.

## Movies

Well this certainly wasn't my most busy year watching Movies. I think I watched a lot of TV instead. Still, I was able to [watch 52 movies][1]—a few even in Italian.

I rewatched a lot, including going through all the Star Trek films ("Hello, Computer"), rewatching all the Indiana Jones movies, and a bunch of classic movies over Christmas break. Some stand out highlights for me this year were:

 - __["One Hundred Steps"][3]__ (Italian: "I cento passi")—a based on a real story about a small town in Sicily. As I've been learning Italian I've also been trying to learn about modern Italian history. This is one of a few I watched but it had me reading wikipedia about the events it was based on.
 - __["Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"][4]__—Say what you want about bringing back another Indy movie after Crystal Skull, but I had a really fun time with this movie. It reminded me of the fun of an Indy movie but didn't try to hide too much from age. It all culminates in a wild fantastical ending that had me just grinning like a kid. This is a fun movie.
 - __["Millenium"][5]__—Not a highlight but really a lowlight. I watched this movie several times when I was a kid and my memory of it was a fascinating time travel story. I rewatched it this year and it's not a good movie. My memory of it was better. I miss that movie. It's risky to rewatch movies from childhood.
 
## TV

TV was much more exciting of a year for me. I've struggled to remember everything I watched that was really good—probably forgetting something. I wish I kept up with TV like I do movies so I don't have a cool image like I get from Letterboxd. Still, some notable highlights:

 - __"Last of Us"__—I thought I was bored with zombie-based shows after getting tired of The Walking Dead years ago. This however told such a great story—especially the Nick Offerman episode. I rarely listen to making of podcasts but tuned in weekly for this one.
 - __"Foundation"__—This show is hard to describe, it's science fiction spanning generations touching on themes of religion and fascism, but it has me on the edge of my seat. Every season ends with me wanting more.
 - __"Doctor Who"__—If you know me you know I'm a whovian. It's a show that can do anything, anywhere, and anywhen. The 4 specials brought back a Doctor as the 14th doctor and introduced a new 15th doctor. Doctor Who is my deserted island entertainment.
 - __"Star Trek: Picard Season 3"__—This show accomplished such a wonderful end to the series. It was able to bring fan service for the story, not just because. It was an unnecessary good bye to the characters but I'm glad I had a chance to see them all again. Only problem was lack of Wesley Crusher!
 - __"Star Treck: Strange New Worlds Season 2"__—Some of the most fun I've had watching TV this year. It's fun and challenges the ideas of Star Trek. Plus we got to see Spock sing.
 - __"Guida astrologica per cuori infranti" ("An Astrological Guide for Broken Hearts")__—It's not a new show this year but we binged it all. On the surface it's a simple romantic comedy but the characters are so good and fun to watch them go through hijinx. I've rewatched it a few times too to practice Italian.
 - __"My Brilliant Friend"__—A show about two friends growing up and growing apart. It's frustrating, maddening, fun, annoying, exciting. I wasn't expecting to think about this show as much as I have.
 - __"GenV"__—The last show I watched of the year. It's in "The Boys" universe and it shows—this is not a superhero show for kids. It's so on point with modern life all through the lens of superheros. I've never seen a spinoff fit so well into it's original show while also being its own thing. 

## Music

As you may have guessed I mostly listened to Italian music this year. In fact here's a [playlist of all my favorites][2]. Some songs I sing along with and get stuck in my head have been:

 - "L'ultima notte" by ARIETE
 - "Di Notte" by Ernia, featuring Carl Brave & Sfera Ebbasta
 - "Ciao Ciao" by La rappresentante di lista
 - "La musica no c'è" by Coez

Well, that's a year. I expect next year will be mostly the same, just more Italian and maybe more films.
