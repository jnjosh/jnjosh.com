[CocoaHeads](http://cocoaheads.org) is a great thing. Once a month our [local community](http://meetup.trianglecocoa.com) gathers together to talk about Apple Development, be geeks, and even talk about the latest movies. I like to imagine it as mini-WWDCs happening once a month, all over the world. That was the one flaw though, I'd like to visit all the CocoaHeads and see what they are talking about too. I noticed a few other groups had recorded their meetings, so [I started recording our sessions](https://vimeo.com/channels/trianglecocoa) hoping that more groups would do the same.

It hasn't happened yet -- most groups don't record their sessions. What if there was a site that aggregated videos from all CocoaHeads groups? Would creating a place specifically for CocoaHeads videos help?

I think it's worth exploring, so a couple weeks ago I launched [**CocoaHeads TV**](http://cocoaheads.tv). Right now we have videos from [Australia](http://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/australia/), [China](http://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/china/), [France](http://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/france/), and the [United States](http://cocoaheads.tv/videos/world/us/).
