I've often wanted to do a yearly roundup of the tools and utilities I use; if only as a log of
things I use over time. I [did this two years ago in
2012](/posts/my-developer-tools-for-mac-and-ios-development-2012-edition/) and when I was thinking
about getting back to blogging I wanted to update the list. The funny thing is not much has changed.
I'm actually surprised that I don't use that many tools.

### Hardware ###

- [__Retina MacBook Pro__](http://store.apple.com) - Still working with my 2012 Retina MacBook Pro with 2.3 GHz i7, 16 GB RAM, and 256gb SSD running OS X 10.10 Yosemite.
- [__27" Thunderbolt Display__](http://store.apple.com) - Still love this monitor. After a lot of time using the MacBook Pro in clamshell mode, I've been using it as a second screen. It makes it much easier to disconnect.
- [__KBC Poker 2 Mechanical Keyboard__](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIA2C512M7560) - Last year I made the switch to using a mechanical keyboard. I love this little thing. Mine has [Cherry MX Blue Switches and custom Dvorak keys](http://jsh.in/XQ2j).
- [__Apple Magic Mouse__](http://store.apple.com/) - I've tried many mice. This is not my favorite, but it allows for some of OS X's gestures. I think I'm going to attempt switching to tha trackpad this year.
- [__iPhone 6 and iPad mini Retina__](http://store.apple.com/) - These are quite obvious, but I use them every day for daily use and development.
- [__Timbuk2 D-Lux Laptop Messenger__](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00E1O4LFQ) - I've switched to the messenger version of the backpack I used two years ago. I really like this bag but still love the backpack too. I'll probably switch again in the future.

### Software ###

#### Developer Tools ####

- [__Xcode 6__](http://developer.apple.com) - I write software for iOS and Mac, this is the tool I use every day. Instruments is another app, but I'll consider it part of Xcode.
- [__BBEdit__](http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/) - I switched to using BBEdit. I've tried it several times in the past, but was convinced to try it again. Now it's part of my daily tools.
- [__Kaleidoscope 2__](http://www.kaleidoscopeapp.com/) - Whenever I push new commits to Github, I check them out first in Kaleidoscope first.
- [__Transmit__](http://panic.com/transmit/) - Still the best tool for uploading via FTP or to S3.
- [__Dash__](http://kapeli.com/dash) - _Update: Can't believe I forgot this!_ Dash is the best tool for reading documentation. I use it so much it was really easy to forget. It feels like it is a part of the system.

#### Other Software and Utilities ####

- [__Alfred__](http://www.alfredapp.com/) - Even though Spotlight in Yosemite replaces most of what I use Alfred for, I still like using Alfred more.
- [__Divvy__](http://mizage.com/divvy/) - I still use divvy every day. It's a great tool and allows me to organize my screen really quickly.
- [__CloudApp__](http://getcloudapp.com) - I'm often sharing links, photos or files with people on the internet. Transmitting these files used to be a huge problem. Now it is easy with CloudApp. I simply hit my keyboard shortcut on a file or URL and it gets uploaded and a short link is created. I have 'jsh.in' mapped to it so all my links look like mine.
- [__Reeder__](http://reederapp.com/) - I have a huge RSS feed of many Mac and iOS development blogs and reeder has fit as my favorite reeder. I actually stopped using it for a little while but then switched back.
- [__Clock.app__](https://github.com/zachwaugh/Clock.app) - [I still keep the clock off my menu bar and use the open source Clock.app](/posts/back-to-blogging-and-working-without-a-clock/).
