*This month at [Triangle CocoaHeads](http://trianglecocoa.com) in Durham, I stepped away from being just the organizer and did a talk on automated acceptance testing with [Calabash](http://calaba.sh). This is a topic I'm really excited to learn more about and am constantly trying to become a better tester.*

I first learned about Calabash when seeing a video of one of the blitz talks from [NSConference](http://ideveloper.tv/nsconference/) about it. I started using it on one project and it seemed to do a nice job.

I think the talk went over pretty well, and since I record the presentations from CocoaHeads you can see for yourself:

You can also [download the presentation as a keynote file](http://jsh.in/IOHx).
