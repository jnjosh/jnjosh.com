Late last year at [Highrise](http://www.joinhighrise.com) we were working on hiring a new server engineer for our team. We weren't really clear what we were looking for and different parts of the team had different ideas about the ideal candidate. I worked with the team to overhaul our system to create a [better process for choosing candidates](http://www.joinhighrise.com/blog/engineering/hiring-engineers-is-hard/). Last week Gusto published an [article about our system which is a really great write-up about our system](https://gusto.com/resources/articles/hr/hiring/hiring-document-highrise).
