As little as I blog here it might be a surprise that I'm starting a different blog but here we are. Over the last year, I've spent a lot of time learning Italian, learning how to cook Italian, and learning about my family history and genealogy. So much that I just want to talk about it all the time. Most people don't want to hear me talk about Italy all the time so it's an outlet.
