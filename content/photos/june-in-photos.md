We didn’t do too many photography trips in June, only going to a few places—but those places were great!

It had been more than 5 years since we went down to the beach, which is absurd—it’s only about 2 hours drive from here. We finally fixed this with a day trip to Kure Beach, NC.

I unfortunately got sunscreen in my eyes so didn’t feel like taking many more photos—hopefully we go again in July.

Last weekend we tried to visit Eno River State Park, but it was too hot and humid, so we didn’t stay long.
