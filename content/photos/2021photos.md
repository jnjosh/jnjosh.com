I’ve been meaning to make more photo posts here over the years and always forget. I am posting over on [flickr](https://www.flickr.com/photos/87151163@N00/) somewhat regularly but I'd really like to keep this as the source of all the things I am doing and will do. Unfortunately I don't really want to flood several photo posts here so instead it'll be a medley of my favorite photos so far this year. 

In 2020 we did a lot of parks and nature photos. Starting off this year we thought we’d change things a bit and walk around Durham instead.

In March, we were back to our old nature photography loving selves with trips to both Falls Lake and Wilkerson Nature Preserve.

In April, we tried to get some spring flowers into the mix with a visit to the WRAL Azalea Garden.

Finally in May we went to Chapel Hill’s Gene Strowd Community Rose Garden
