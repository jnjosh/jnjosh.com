# RealPass for iPhone

This was my first real project to learn the iPhone SDK. I didn't release it until after iAdvent though. I removed it from sale in 2009.

<br />

RealPass generates passwords that you'll actually remember. Just plug in a secret word that only you know and RealPass will inserts randomly selected characters for each letter of the word. Characters could be lower or upper case letters, numbers, or symbols.

<br />

While other password generators create passwords that are difficult to remember, RealPass starts with something that's already memorable to the user. RealPass is FREE, so give it a try today! WHAT IS X3Rr3!2@w MEAN ANYWAY? No more X3d3r@!e3! With RealPass, words like 'cheesecake' are converted to 'cH3353C@ke' or other randomly created options. If you don't like the first generation, hit create until you come up with a password you do like. Create a password to remember!
